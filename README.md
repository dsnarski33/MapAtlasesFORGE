Map Atlases for FORGE

A FORGE port of MapAtlases (www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/map-atlases).
I liked this implementation better than the other similar mods out there for FORGE. So I made it work
for the Minecraft version that I am currently focused on using, 1.18.2. This should mirror Map Atlases v2.6.0.
